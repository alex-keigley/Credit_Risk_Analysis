# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Supervised machine learning module challenge

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project was to showcase different methods of supervised machine learning, with a variety of samples including those that are undersampled, oversampled, and a mixture of both.

## Results
* Naive Random Oversampling - 64.6% accuracy
* SMOTE Oversampling - 62.8% accuracy
* Random Undersampling - 59% accuracy
* Combination Sampling - 51% accuracy
* Balanced Random Forest Classifier - 99% accuracy
* Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier - 91% accuracy

## Summary
Based on the resutls obtained from this analysis I would recomend using the Easy Ensemble AdabBoost Classifier, as it manages to be very accurate, but not perfect. I chose this over the Balanced Random Forest Classifier method, as with it's extremely high accuracy there are concerns that may have just memorized the dataset.
